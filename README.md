Natural Resource Management (NRM) project Scripts to be run in the Google Earth Engine platform


The Natural Resources Management (NRM) project is a sub-project of the larger project MIDST (Monitoring for Information and Decisions using Space Technologies), piloted by the Kenya Space Agency (KSA) AND conducted in collaboration with a team from the following Government institutions:
   1) Kenya Space Agency
   2) Water Resources Authority
   3) Kenya Forest Service
   4) Directorate of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing
   5) Kenya Wildlife Service
   6) Jommo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
   7) Kenya Defence Forces
   8) United Natoins Food and Agriculture Organization.
   
This repository contains the scripts created using the Google Earth Engine platform, to produce and analyze satellite images of the following forest Areas:
  1) Aberdares Forest
  2) Ngong Hills Forest
  3) Kibiku Forest
  4) Oloolua Forest
  
The scripts produce cloud free images from sentinel-2, and use the images to produce land cover classification images of the said regoins above.
Each region's code is enclosed in its own folder/ directory, with the resources required for each script contained in folders within the same direstory, i.e. shape files.

Use the google earth Engine's assets tab to ingest the shape files into your GEE project repository and import them into the script, with the same name as the one used in the scripts.
